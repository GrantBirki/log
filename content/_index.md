This is a minimal web log inspired by Dario Amodei's personal [website](https://darioamodei.com/). It is designed to be as minimal, performant, and as elegant as possible for reading. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator written in Go. The theme is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrantBirki/dario).
